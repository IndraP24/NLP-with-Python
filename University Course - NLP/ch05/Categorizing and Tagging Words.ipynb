    "\n",
    "### Unigram taggers are based on a simple statistical algorithm: for each token, assign the tag that is most likely for that particular token. For example, it will assign the tag JJ to any occurrence of the word frequent, since frequent is used as an adjective (e.g. a frequent word) more often than it is used as a verb (e.g. I frequent this cafe). A unigram tagger behaves just like a lookup tagger (4), except there is a more convenient technique for setting it up, called training. In the following code sample, we train a unigram tagger, use it to tag a sentence, then evaluate:"

As with n-gram tagging, this is a supervised learning method, since we need annotated training data to figure out whether the tagger's guess is a mistake or not. However, unlike n-gram tagging, it does not count observations but compiles a list of transformational correction rules."

    "### In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Once performed by hand, POS tagging is now done in the context of computational linguistics, using algorithms which associate discrete terms, as well as hidden parts of speech, by a set of descriptive tags. POS-tagging algorithms fall into two distinctive groups: rule-based and stochastic. E. Brill's tagger, one of the first and most widely used English POS-taggers, employs rule-based algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### POS tagging finds applications in Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, question answering, and word sense disambiguation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level—whether the expressed opinion in a document, a sentence or an entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral. Advanced, \"beyond polarity\" sentiment classification looks, for instance, at emotional states such as enjoyment, anger, disgust, sadness, fear, and surprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we find is that companies today are monitoring social media to improve sales, marketing, and customer service, including the evaluation of brand perception. Are people happy with our products? What do they not like about our product? How can we improve our service and offerings? Was our recent product launch/marketing conference well received by our partners and customers? How do customers view our competitors? These are questions that sales, marketing, and service departments in many companies are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Social media sentiment analysis is also of interest to algorithmic trading systems. For example, some companies might be interested in building a predictive model that correlates the sentiment in Tweets with a stock symbol or a commodity future of interest. The system would have to compute a sentiment score for relevant tweets. One simple way of coming up with a sentiment score for a tweet would be to use a sentiment dictionary—a collection of positive and negative words (See Prof. Jason Baldridge for a comprehensive tutorial on Practical Sentiment Analysis). By looking up the words in the tweet with those in the sentiment dictionary, one can define the ratio of positive words in a tweet to the total number of positive and negative words as the sentiment score for the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are several pitfalls in this approach, and one key problem is the absence of context. To incorporate such contextual information into our simple sentiment scoring algorithm, we first need to extract phrases from the tweets. We can then count the number of tweets in which each phrase occurred as a very strong, positive adjective like “excellent” and the number of occurrences with a very strong negative adjective like “poor.” Using these two counts, we can come-up with a sentiment score for the extracted phrase, and ‘strong winds’ is likely to have a negative score while ‘strong yield’ is likely to have a positive score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The extraction of such adjectives along with their context is the building block of a seminal paper on sentiment analysis by Peter Turney. The task that helps us extract these contextual phrases is a well-studied problem in natural language processing (NLP) called parts-of-speech (POS) tagging. POS tagging of raw text is a fundamental building block of many NLP pipelines such as word-sense disambiguation, question answering and sentiment analysis. In its simplest form, given a sentence, POS tagging is the task of identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and more. In practice, many NLP tasks use a much richer tagset for part-of-speech, the Penn Treebank corpus for instance, has a tagset of 36 POS tags."
